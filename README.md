How to Run the Program

3) Choose a number from the drop down menu

4) Click on generate password.

5) A pop up should appear saying a password has been successfully generated. This means that the password is in your clipboard.

Important
---------

- Password is 12 characters long and contains capital letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers.

- The program will prompt you to pick another image if your image is too small or does not contain enough RGB values.

- Always remember what image you chose and what number from the drop down menu you chose. Next time you need to log in to an account that uses a password from pictHasher, you need to input the same number and image.
